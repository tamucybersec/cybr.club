🧠 Windsurf Local Policy – DO NOT COMMIT THIS FOLDER

📦 Package Management
- Use **npm** only. No yarn, pnpm, or lockfiles from other managers.
- Auto-delete `yarn.lock` and `pnpm-lock.yaml` if found.

🎨 Styling Philosophy
- Use **TailwindCSS** with custom configuration in `tailwind.config.ts`.
- Combine Tailwind with **global CSS** for base styles only.
- Follow **shadcn/ui** principles: clean, composable, and minimal component styling.

🧩 Animations
- Use **Framer Motion** for state-based animations.
- Use **GSAP** for timeline or scroll-driven interactions.

🛠 Next.js Practices
- Follow official best practices:
  - Use **App Router (app/)** structure.
  - Use **Server Components** by default, **Client Components** only when necessary.
  - No dynamic routes without purpose.
  - Optimize for static rendering where possible.

🧹 Windsurf Rules
- No renaming, no `.new` files.
- No destructive moves.
- Make incremental, clean file adjustments only.
- Do not auto-generate files or run codegen steps.
- ensure that ui is always fully responsive on all screen sizes.

🖥 Runtime
- This system is used on **PowerShell**, not Linux or Bash.
- All scripts must be compatible with Node.js on Windows.

❌ Always Delete:
- `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`
- `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`
- `.vscode/*` (optional, if local config only)

🛑 Do not commit `.windsurf/`. This is local only.
