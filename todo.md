# Dashboard

-   Get stats for grad semester during registration
-   Save the semester and year during which the user _first_ registered
-   Better legacy data storage
    -   Store attendance as an object where the key is the $year_$year and the value is the number they attended
    -   Be able to go back and look at statistics for previous semesters
    -   Pie chart for number of events per semester (can't do because of bad legacy maintenance)

# Improvements

-   Make landing page flashy and properly display best parts of the club
-   Improve colors and styling
-   attend to all todos
-   place all activity leads in one file and import it for easy editing
-   put activity leads in the about page
-   better naming for navbar pages (about and events in particular)
-   the mailing list is a demon from beyond the seventh layer of hell
-   the contact for is a similar beast
